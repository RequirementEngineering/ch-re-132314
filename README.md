Requirements Engineering

Requirement: Descriptions of the services that a system should provide and the constraints of its operation. The reflect the needs of customers for a system.

User Requirements: Statements of what services the system is expected to provide to users and the constraints under which it must operate. This are usually written down in a natural language.
System Requirements: Detailed descriptions of the software system's functions, services, and operational constraints. The document that contains this requirements should define exactly what is suposed to be implemented.

Feasibility Study: Short and focused study that should take place early in the requirement engineering process. It answers three questions: Does the system contribute to the overall objectives of the organization?, Can the system be implemented within schedule and budget using current technology?, and Can the system be integrated with other systems that are used? Should any of the answers of any of the questions be "no", then going on with the project is not adviced.

Functional Requirements: This requirements describe what the system should do. They depend on the type of software that is in development, the expected end user, and the general approach taken by the organization when writing requirements. Imprecision in the requirements can lead to disputes between customers and developers because usually the developer can interpret an ambiguous requirement in a simplified way to make the implementation easier. This results in not meeting the customer needs so new requirements have to be established, delaying the system delivery and incrementing costs.
Non-Functional Requirements: This requirements are not directly concerned with the services delivered by the system, they usually specify or constrain characteristics of the system as a whole(reliability, response time, memory use, etc.). Mosts times is difficult to identify which system components implement specific non-functional requirements. This may be for the next two reasons:
